# Hi, I'm Matiullah!

I'm a BSCS student at PAF-KIET, currently in my second year. I have a keen interest in C# programming and ASP.NET Core development. I'm actively seeking opportunities to work with C# and ASP.NET Core projects.

### Point of Sale (POS) System

I have developed a fully object-oriented programming (OOP) based POS system using C# and WinForms. The system includes the following features:

- User authentication and access control

- Inventory management
- Reporting and analytics

The project allowed me to apply my knowledge of OOP concepts, database integration, and user interface design.
